Mycelia is a custom boss coded for my Super Mario World romhack "Mycelium". You can download the hack to play it here: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=35259

Additionally, you can see this boss in action in this video of spratt's TAS of the game: https://youtu.be/1dXUyNKAKQg?si=bjS7wEr-81Ykjyug&t=477


This boss' movements and attacks are choreographed through Uber ASM, rather than within the boss sprites themselves. This made it easier to synchronize the movement of the two eye sprites - the level ASM ends up acting as the "brains" of the operation.

Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions about the workings of this bossfight. You are welcome to take inspiration from the patterns I use, but do not copy large swathes of code.

Happy coding, and thanks for stopping by :)
